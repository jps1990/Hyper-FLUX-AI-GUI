## Supported Models
Straight from `main.js`, here’s what you get to play with:

- **Hyper-FLUX 16-step**:  
  A high-res, 16-step model for people with patience and overclocked GPUs.  
  Model version: `lucataco/hyper-flux-16step:382cf8959fb0f0d665b26e7e80b8d6dc3faaef1510f14ce017e8c732bb3d1eb7`.

- **Hyper-FLUX 8-step**:  
  Less patience required than the 16-step version, but still not for the faint of heart.  
  Model version: `lucataco/hyper-flux-8step:81946b1e09b256c543b35f37333a30d0d02ee2cd8c4f77cd915873a1ca622bad`.

- **Flux-Dev**:  
  Fresh from **Black Forest Labs**—this is where the real innovation happens.  
  Model version: `black-forest-labs/flux-dev`.

- **Flux-Pro**:  
  For the pros, or those who like to pretend they are.  
  Model version: `black-forest-labs/flux-pro`.

- **Flux-Schnell**:  
  "Schnell" means fast in German. Don’t get too excited though—it’s still AI.  
  Model version: `black-forest-labs/flux-schnell`.

- **MidJourney V3**:  
  Yes, you read that right. This is the MidJourney V3 model for generating stunning visuals—perfect for showing off on social media and pretending you made them from scratch.  
  Model version: `fofr/flux-mjv3:f8bba190713142471df7ef2adba00fe9c84f5d63b5c48702082f2718e7f4d8b2`.
