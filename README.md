# Hyper-FLUX-AI-GUI

### What is this thing?
An app that somehow still works, despite everything being dumped into a single file. If you're here, you're either lost or a fan of DIY chaos. Welcome.

---

## Features
- Replicate API integration, which means it can run AI models, assuming you’re brave enough to figure out how.
- Glowing UI that could blind you if you stare too long—using cutting-edge CSS tricks like *"let’s put everything in Orbitron"*.
- Totally functional buttons that do things, maybe.

---

## Prerequisites
Before you get this bad boy running, you're going to need a couple of things:
- **Node.js** (because obviously)
- **Replicate API** account and token (seriously, get one, or the app is just a fancy black screen).

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repo. Yes, you need the whole thing, no picking favorites:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/hyper-flux-ai-gui.git
    cd hyper-flux-ai-gui
    ```

2. Install dependencies, because this is a civilized project:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your Replicate API token:
    ```bash
    REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_your_token_goes_here
    ```

## Running the App
Now for the exciting part! Fire up the app with:

```bash
npm start
